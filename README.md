Amphibians App
==================================

The second independent project for Android Basics in Kotlin. This project pairs
with Unit 4 of Android Basics in Kotlin https://developer.android.
com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/unit-4

Introduction
------------

The first commit is the starter code for the Amphibian app project. All the following commits 
are my work.

The app displays a list of amphibian data from the network. The amphibian data comes from a JSON 
object returned by the API.

The completed app and its functionality is described below:

- The first screen the user will see displays the names of each species in a recycler view.
- Tapping a list item navigates to the detail screen which also displays the species' name as 
  well as a detailed description.

While the UI portion of this app has already been implemented, running the starter project won't 
show any data. My task is to implement the networking portion of the app, and then show the 
downloaded data in the layout.

Tasks
---------------

- Download the starter code
- Complete the project in accordance with the app requirements
- Use the provided tests to ensure the app is running as expected
- DO NOT ALTER THE PROVIDED TESTS
